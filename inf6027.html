                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Stock price volatility serves as a critical indicator of market risk, reflecting economic conditions, market sentiment, and liquidity dynamics. This research examines the drivers of volatility in the Health and Technology sectors, focusing on sector-specific influences such as regulatory decisions and innovation cycles. Using advanced feature engineering and predictive modeling, it evaluates key patterns and the performance of models like Random Forest and XGBoost. The findings aim to enhance understanding of sector-specific risks, offering insights for investors and policymakers.

                <ul>
                    <li>What are the key patterns and relationships between weekly trading volume, price movements, and stock price volatility in the health and technology sectors?</li>
                    <li>How do features such as lagged values, moving averages, and momentum indicators influence stock price volatility in these sectors?</li>
                    <li>How do predictive models perform in forecasting stock price volatility, and what are the sector-specific differences in their predictive accuracy?</li>

                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher trading volumes were strongly correlated with price volatility, particularly in the technology sector.</li>
                    <li>Features such as VWAP, Bollinger Bands, and RSI emerged as key predictors of volatility.</li>
                    <li>XGBoost consistently outperformed Random Forest, achieving higher RÂ² values and lower RMSE in both sectors.</li>
                    <li>Technology stocks demonstrated higher predictive accuracy due to greater feature variability, while health stocks required stability-focused features.</li>
                    <li>Lagged weekly returns played a pivotal role in forecasting stock price volatility.</li>
